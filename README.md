# RAt
Cross Platform Remote Administrative Tool
This script appears to be a Python script that defines various functions that allow the user to remotely administer a Windows computer. The functions include opening a browser, turning on/off/rebooting the monitor, viewing system drivers, exiting an application, sending a message to the computer, displaying CPU cores, displaying system information, verifying if the current user is an admin, getting the local time, extending user privileges, disabling/enabling the task manager, and getting the current location of the computer.

The script defines a `handle_command` function that takes a command string as input, parses the command, and calls the appropriate function based on the command.

The script sets up a TCP/IP socket server that listens for incoming connections. When a connection is established, the server receives data from the client and passes the received data to the `handle_command` function. The output of the `handle_command` function is then sent back to the client.

Overall, this script provides a basic implementation of a remote administrative tool that can be used to administer a Windows computer over a network. However, the script may have security vulnerabilities and may need to be modified to work in different network environments.
